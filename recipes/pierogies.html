    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Pierogi, boiled dumplings, are very flexible and can be stuffed with a number of savory or sweet fillings, including potato and cheese (below);
        sauerkraut, cabbage, spiced meats, and even fruits and berries. Because pierogi freeze well, they make quick, satisfying last-minute meals. 
        There are as many versions of pierogi as there are cooks who love them, and our take on this traditional treat mirrors many American pierogi recipes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon table salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, room temperature</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup sharp cheddar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>To finish:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 large shallots, diced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <h3>Making dough:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together the flour and salt. Add the egg to the flour and combine. The dough will be quite clumpy at this stage.</li>
            <li>Work in the sour cream and soft butter until the dough comes together in a slightly rough, slightly sticky ball.</li>
            <li>Using just your fingertips, knead and fold the dough without adding additional flour until the dough becomes less sticky but still quite moist.</li>
            <li>Wrap the dough well in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes, or up to 48 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Combine the warm mashed potato and cheese. Stir and mash until the cheese is melted and the filling is cool to the touch. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>To fill pierogies:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll half the dough 1/8" thick. Use a 2" round cutter to cut circles of dough. Repeat with the other half of the dough. Save the scraps; these can be snipped into small pieces and added to simmering soups.</li>
            <li>Place 1 1/2 teaspoons of filling on each round of dough. Gently fold the dough over, forming a pocket around the filling. Pinch the edges of the pierogi to seal, then seal again with the tines of a fork.</li>
            <li>At this point the pierogi can be frozen for up to 4 weeks, or refrigerated overnight, or cooked in a large stockpot of boiling salted water. Only cook about 10 pierogi at a time, so that they have room to float without sticking. When the pierogi float, they're done. The time will vary depending on if they're fresh or frozen.</li>
            <li>Saut√© the shallots or onion in the butter in a large skillet until the onion begins to brown. Add the drained pierogi and cook until browned and crisped. Serve hot with additional sour cream, applesauce, or other condiments.</li>
        </ol>
