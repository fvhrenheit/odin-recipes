Hello there! (I hope nobody reads this...)
So here we are, this is my very first small HTML "project". Just few simple pages to use what I learned with The Odin Project and make sure I won't forget it too soon haha.

I made very simple index page along with two pages with Polish recipes! (In cease you didn't guess, that's my home counry lol)

In this "project" I have used what I learned about:
- linking pages to index page
- using git (commit, push and add files)
- making ordered and unordered lists
- adding images
...and much more.

If there's anyone who spent time reading this (I still hope you didn't), Thank you!
